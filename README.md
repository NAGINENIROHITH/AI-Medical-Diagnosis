# AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System  

## 🏥 Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered medical diagnosis system** that predicts multiple diseases using **Machine Learning (ML) models**. It provides a user-friendly **Streamlit-based** web interface where users can input their medical details and get disease predictions.

## 📌 Features  
- **Supports Multiple Diseases**:  
  - Diabetes Prediction  
  - Heart Disease Prediction  
  - Parkinson’s Disease Prediction  
  - Lung Cancer Prediction  
  - Hypo-Thyroid Prediction  
- **Interactive UI** with Streamlit  
- **Machine Learning Models** trained with real datasets  
- **Easy to Use** – Just input your details and get instant results  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy)**  
- **Streamlit** (for Web UI)  
- **Pickle** (for saving & loading models)

## 📌 Usage
This AI-powered medical diagnosis system helps users predict diseases based on their medical data.
1. Run the application using Streamlit:
```
  streamlit run app.py
```
2. Select a disease from the dropdown menu.

3. Enter the required medical details in the input fields.

4. Click the prediction button to get an instant result.

5. The system will display whether the person is likely to have the disease or not.

## 📊 Results
This project utilizes machine learning models trained on real datasets to predict diseases accurately.

Diabetes Prediction: Provides results based on glucose levels, BMI, age, etc.
Heart Disease Prediction: Analyzes blood pressure, cholesterol, and other risk factors.
Parkinson’s Disease Prediction: Uses voice-related features to detect Parkinson’s.
Lung Cancer Prediction: Evaluates symptoms like coughing, wheezing, and smoking history.
Hypo-Thyroid Prediction: Predicts thyroid disorders based on hormone levels.
Each prediction is displayed in an easy-to-understand format, providing either a "Positive" or "Negative" diagnosis.

## Future Work
Add more disease predictions

Improve UI/UX

Deploy to the cloud (AWS/GCP)
